# üìù Week 2 Assignment ‚Äì Getting Started with AI Models

## üìå Instructions
This week‚Äôs assignment combines **concept understanding, practice, and research**.  
You will prepare a **PowerPoint presentation (.pptx)** to present in class next week.  

---

## Part 1: Theory Review
1. Study and understand all concepts from this week‚Äôs lecture:
   - AI ‚Üí ML ‚Üí DL ‚Üí LLM hierarchy
   - Base model vs Fine-tuned model
   - Full Fine-tuning vs Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)
   - LoRA / QLoRA basics
   - RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
   - System prompts (role, tone, rules)

Include **slides summarizing these concepts** in your own words.

---

## Part 2: Environment Setup
2. Download and install:
   - [Ollama](https://ollama.com)  
   - [Chatbox](https://chatboxapp.xyz)  

Add a **screenshot** in your slides to show successful installation.

---

## Part 3: System Prompt Experiment
3. Research online for examples of **system prompts**.  
   - Use at least 3 variations (e.g., teacher, reviewer, friendly).  
   - Ask the **same question** with each prompt.  
   - Show how the answers change.  

Present your findings in a **table or comparison slide**.

---

## Part 4: Running Multiple Models
4. Use Ollama to **download and run at least 4 models**:
   - Required:  
     - `gemma:4b`  
     - `llama3.1:8b`  
   - Plus **two others of your choice** (e.g., `mistral:7b`, `deepseek-coder:6.7b`, `phi3:3.8b`).  

Run the **same system prompt + same question** for all models.  
Compare:
- Runtime (seconds)  
- Response quality  

Present results in a **table and graph**.

---

## Part 5: Research Project
5. Research **at least 3 AI models** that could be useful for **remote sensing** (coding, hyperspectral imaging, image classification, segmentation).  

For each model, include:
- Name  
- Developer/organization  
- Open-source or closed-source  
- Why it is useful for remote sensing  

Summarize findings in slides.

---

## ‚úÖ Deliverable
- A **PowerPoint presentation (.pptx)** with:
  1. Summary of theory concepts  
  2. Installation screenshot  
  3. System prompt comparison table  
  4. Model runtime comparison table + graph  
  5. Research findings on AI for remote sensing  

üëâ You will present your slides in class next week.
