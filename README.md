# AI Assistant Class â€“ This Semester

Welcome to our advanced AI development class, where we focus on building a domain-specific AI assistant for remote sensing and geoscience. This course builds upon coding and machine learning concepts from previous semesters and introduces specialized methods for AI model adaptation, deployment, and optimization.

## Course Overview
This semester, we will:
1. **Understand AI Assistant Architecture**  
   Explore the structure of AI assistants, focusing on system prompts, data integration, and LoRA fine-tuning for domain-specific tasks.

2. **Implement Domain-Specific Knowledge**  
   Collect, clean, and format datasets from geology, hyperspectral imaging, and remote sensing to inject knowledge into pre-trained AI models.

3. **Develop Efficient Training Pipelines**  
   Apply LoRA and QLoRA workflows for efficient fine-tuning of large language models with limited compute resources.

4. **Enhance Multimodal Capabilities**  
   Extend AI assistants to process both text and image queries, combining them for more accurate and useful responses.

5. **Deploy and Package AI Models**  
   Integrate assistants into user-friendly platforms (Ollama, Chatbox UI) and package them as standalone applications using PyInstaller and Inno Setup.

6. **Prevent Model Drift & Optimize Performance**  
   Implement strategies to preserve learned skills, prevent drift, and optimize runtime with quantization.

7. **Showcase and Share Projects**  
   Merge multiple LoRAs, export models for sharing, and present your final AI assistant project.

## What You Will Learn
- Fundamentals of AI assistant design and system prompts.
