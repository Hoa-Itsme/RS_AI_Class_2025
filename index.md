# AI Assistant Class – This Semester

Welcome to our advanced AI development class, where we build a domain-specific AI assistant for remote sensing and geoscience tasks.

## Course Overview
This semester, we will:
1. **Understand AI Assistant Architecture**  
   Explore how modern AI assistants are structured, focusing on system prompts, data integration, and LoRA fine-tuning.

2. **Implement Domain-Specific Knowledge**  
   Inject knowledge from geology, remote sensing, and hyperspectral imaging into pre-trained AI models.

3. **Develop Efficient Training Pipelines**  
   Apply LoRA and QLoRA workflows for efficient model adaptation with limited resources.

4. **Enhance Multimodal Capabilities**  
   Add image processing and combined text–image reasoning to improve assistant performance.

5. **Optimize and Deploy Models**  
   Use quantization and packaging tools (PyInstaller, Inno Setup) for fast deployment.

6. **Evaluate and Showcase Projects**  
   Prevent model drift, preserve learned skills, and merge multiple LoRAs into unified assistants for real-world use.

## What You Will Learn
- Ollama, Chatbox, and prompt-based AI assistant design.
- Collecting, cleaning, and formatting domain-specific datasets.
- LoRA/QLoRA workflows for fine-tuning large models.
- Replay set strategies for incremental training.
- Prompt chaining and advanced system prompts.
- Multimodal AI integration (text + images).
- Speed optimization with quantization.
- Packaging and sharing trained assistants.

## Getting Started
1. **Prerequisites**: Python knowledge, basic ML concepts, and familiarity with remote sensing workflows.
2. **Tools & Libraries**: Python 3.x, Hugging Face Transformers, Ollama, Chatbox UI, PyTorch/TensorFlow, LoRA/QLoRA libraries.
3. **Project Structure**: Scripts, datasets, LoRA checkpoints, and deployment files organized for clarity and collaboration.

## How to Contribute
- **Fork this Repository**: Suggest improvements and submit Pull Requests.
- **Open Issues**: Report bugs or feature requests.
- **Collaborate**: Share your prompts, workflows, and models with peers.

We look forward to developing domain-specific AI assistants together!
